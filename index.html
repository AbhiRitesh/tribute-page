                <p class="text-justify intro">Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer
                    and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He took up cricket at the
                    age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of
                    sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to
                    twenty-four years. Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India. As a child,
                    Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the
                    first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire.

                <p class="text-justify more-info">In 2015 he was appointed by BCCI into the Cricket Advisory Committee
                    (CAC). He was one of three in the committee along VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly. He resigned
                    from this job after allegations of conflict of interest on him. CAC was formed
                    by BCCI to appoint a head coach for Indian cricket team. On 23 June 2016, CAC appointed Anil
                    Kumble as national team's head coach. In 2019, Tendulkar made his debut as a Cricket commentator
                    during the 2019 ICC Cricket World
                    Cup.
